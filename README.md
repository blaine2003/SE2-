## Changes:
- Extracted admin/customer pages from Figma
- Added page links to menu bar on index.html
- Uploaded menu bar icons to public/images
- Refactored some class names(There was a class named .andrea-salazar and .andeng lol)

## Challenges:
- Not all codes are exactly the same, harder to make changes
- Folder organization
- Too many files, maybe there is a way to reduce them
- No responsive web design
- Other pages(ex. booking system) are left out on purpose
- The intention is to code the systems from scratch using React/Tailwind/PHP

## To-Do:
- Link these pages to homepage/login
- Simplify code with AI for uniformity and readability
- Responsive Web Design
