        resolve any disputes between us. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES.

        you are not permitted to access or use the Services. These Terms, along with any supplemental terms
        ("Supplemental Terms") that may apply, override any previous agreements or arrangements between us and take
        precedence over any other information you may have encountered, whether on our website, in emails, or through
        other applications. Mar and Nor may terminate this Agreement or any Services related to you at any time, with or

        and Nor Privacy Policy, which are provided with that Service. Supplemental Terms might also include conditions
        for particular events, activities, programs, or promotions. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and
        any Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall take precedence concerning the applicable Service(s).

        Mar and Nor reserves the right to amend these Terms at any time. Such amendments will be effective once posted
        by Mar and Nor. By continuing to access or use the Services after such postings, you consent to be bound by the
        revised Terms.
